Here are the supplements I take : 
- Creatine (5g per day)
- Brazil nuts for selenium (2 a day)
- Algae oil, for EPA/DHA Omega 3s (2 softgels a day : total of 400mg DHA and 200mg EPA)
- Flax seed, for ALA Omega 3s (1tbsp=10g a day)
- Vitamine B12, as I'm vegan (1000Î¼g, twice a week)
- Iodized salt (I should aim for 1 teaspoon a day, but hard to reach)

I also make sure to get enough protein [[fitness-routine|to build muscle]] :
- For breakfast : 2 soy yogurts, rolled oats, and almonds
- 2 protein shakes (each have 1 protein scoop + 500mL of soy milk)
	- The soy milk is reinforced with calcium and vitamin D
