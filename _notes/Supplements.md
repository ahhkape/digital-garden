title: Supplements

Here are the supplements I take : 
- Creatine (5g per day)
- Brazil nuts for selenium (2 a day)
- Algae oil, for EPA/DHA Omega 3s (2 softgels a day : total of 400mg DHA and 200mg EPA)
- Flax seed, for ALA Omega 3s (1tbsp=10g a day)
	- Warning : ground flaxseed is very hard to keep ; oil must be kept refrigerated
- Vitamine B12, as I'm vegan (1000Î¼g, twice a week)
- Iodized salt (I should aim for 1 teaspoon a day, but hard to reach)

I also make sure to get enough protein [[fitness|to build muscle]] :
- For breakfast : 2 soy yogurts (=> lacto-fermented), rolled oats, and almonds
- 2 protein shakes (each have 1 protein scoop + 500mL of soy milk)
	- The soy milk is reinforced with calcium and vitamin D
	

That I could add: zinc/magnesium/K2, other fermented food, third protein shake if I don't get enough  
If I get a blender, I'll include some red peppers and mix of different colour vegetables
- Consume smoothie immediately after blending, and don't blend too long to not degrade nutrients with heat

I don't take any supplements while I'm on the move, and I don't make up for it when I come back. Apparently body can't stock the double dose. And saves some money / hedges in case some are ineffective.
