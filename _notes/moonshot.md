	- Quote from somewhere : "Britain should reclaim an area the size of Wales from Dogger Bank, the area of the North Sea where the sea is only 15-40m deep. We could do it for less than £100bn"

	- Pueyo : the reduction in mortality from cooling—a benefit—is roughly _ten times larger_ than the increase in mortality from air pollution and ozone loss—a harm.
	
- Markets in everything 
	- Immigration, organs and blood
