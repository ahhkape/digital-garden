title: Changes I'd like to do

**Watch more movies, less shows** (Zvi). Movies have more value per hour watched. Many shows feel more optimised to be the equivalent of a comfort food. In general, long shows don't let you discover as many different things as movies. Last of all, I have trouble watching just 2h of a show per week. Movies allow for more flexibility in watch time.

**Use paper more often to help with thinking** (Dynomight)
