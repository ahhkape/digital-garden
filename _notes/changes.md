title: Changes I'd like to do
---

**Watch more movies, less shows** (Zvi). Movies have more value per hour watched. Many shows feel more optimised to be the equivalent of a comfort food. In general, long shows don't let you discover as many different things as movies. Last of all, I have trouble watching just 2h of a show per week. Movies allow for more flexibility in watch time.

**Use paper more often to help with thinking** (Dynomight)

**Read more uncorrelated things**. Less current events and politics, more history and older writing.
**More short trips with a group of friends** (Cowen)

**Cold emails**. [[YCJDT|You can just email random people you see on internet]]. [See here](https://quarter--mile.com/emails-for-humans).

Lifestyle changes : 
- Less talk of politics
- Less autistic behaviour : more empathy, small talk, agreeableness (especially with family)
- Write more often
- Lower sugar intake (even if 0 isn't realistic)
	- Snacks outside: hummus and breadsticks, baby carrots
- Meditate everyday

And of course, [[do-more-things|do more things]].
