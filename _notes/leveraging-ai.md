title: Leveraging AI
---

Use for more different things, I haven't thought of yet:
- Meal prep
- Onebag optimisation? Doubt it can add value
- Cunningham : "think through values and goals and develop 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 year plan via an in-depth interviewing process"
- Socratic Tutoring
	- Vinay Ramasesh, via Dwarkesh : "I would benefit most from an explanation style in which you frequently pause to confirm, via asking me test questions, that I've understood your explanations so far. Particularly helpful are test questions related to simple, explicit examples. When you pause and ask me a test question, do not continue the explanation until I have answered the questions to your satisfaction. I.e. do not keep generating the explanation, actually wait for me to respond first. Thanks"
- Ask it directly: which unknown ways of using it?
- New ways I've already incorporated (as of june 2025) : summarising long articles, planning trips,
Be better informed about cutitng edge AI, as a lay person. Easy way would be reading more Zvi

Use the vocal mode more often : to while walking (I would need better earbuds)

Use different AI's, instead of only ChatGPT. I'm not going to pay for different ones, but maybe the free version of eg. Claude or Gemini can be better for some use cases.

Deep Research could probably be useful to me. But I never use it outside of school work.

If I had the money, I would probably benefit from paying for more specialised tools, like those which summarise meetings or Copilot.
