title: For when I have too much free time
---

Most of the year I'm very busy. My day is filled with school, the gym, time with friends, time with my girlfriend, reading. When I have some free time on a typical day I'll do some cleaning, organise my things, spend more time reading..

However, when I have a few full days of free alone time, with no school etc., I'll default to brain-rot activites too easily. Netflix, video-games, etc.

Here are better activities I can do in those moments. I'm jotting them down because when the moment comes, I never think of them, and just default to mindlessly sitting in front of my computer all afternoon.

Reading a non-fiction book (Discworld...)   
Go on a 1-2 hour walk in the city  
Find friends to meet up with  
Do some cardio
