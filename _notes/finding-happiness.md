From Scott: 
Erik Hoel is worried about the semantic apocalypse. In our modern world in which we have everything, it can seem like nothing is worth anything anymore. There may be society-wide solutions. However free will does exist and [[YCJDT]]. The solution Scott mentions is Chesterton's: Just Be Amazed. Enjoy things.



Chestertonâ€™s answer to the semantic apocalypse is to will yourself out of it: PERSONAL NOTE, DO THIS : BACK WITH MEDITATION, ENJOY THINGs
- While Erik Hoel works on the systemic issue to semantic apocalypse, you should be thinking of your own individual soul
