title: My fitness routine
---

My current gym streak began in september 2024. Before that I did some basic calisthenics irregularly and went to the gym in for a few months in 2022. 

Since september I've been running a PPL (two workouts a week each of Push, Pull, and Legs). I skip Legs sometimes. I skip DLs sometimes, when I feel fatigued.
The following weights are always the total amount. Those marked with a * vary greatly depending on the gym/machine. 
I do a 3-5minute warmup at the beginning of each workout, and then warmup for the first exercice by doing 1-2 sets with lower weight, before doing working sets up to the max weight. 
The number of sets are working sets only

Push workout : 
- 4x Dumbbell bench press (up to 60kgs)
- 3x Incline dumbbell bench press (35kgs)
- 3x Machine chest flies (40kgs*)

- 6x Triceps pushdown (25kgs*)
- 8x Dumbbell lateral raise (5kgs), superset with pushdowns
