title: How do we know better countries are better?

For exemple, to show that system X, or ideology Y is preferred.


You begin by deciding what "better" means. For some people, that is economic wealth. But others don't agree, so how do you convince those people? And even for capitalist free-market libertarians, money is of course never the end goal. Liberty is, or happiness.


A good way would be [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference](revealed preferences). Obviously, what people vote for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter](doesn't work). You need to use a choice that really matters.  
I want to use "voting with one's feet". But I'm afraid it doesn't work well. I imagine most international migrations are non-representative: they are done by ambitious, young men. 

Another way would be to use happiness measures. But I don't know if we have a good way of interpreting those. I believe Cowen thinks we do.

Finally, people like Crawford use a capabilities approach. It's good for people to be able to do things, to be able to develop their projects and achieve their ambitions. Thus, economic wealth.
