title: Summer of 2025
---

Almost all of my university friends have an internship this summer. I didn't look for one. I did want to do one initially, but my school has a stringent policy that didn't allow us to begin before the 1st of June. However I wanted to travel this summer, and an internship isn't that interesting if it's only for a few weeks, so I gave up on searching for one. I thought most people wouldn't do one, but almost everyone does actually. If I could go back, I would do probably find an internship just for the month of June.

Here's what I've planned for the summer : 

June
- Helping my parents find and negotiate a loan, for a secondary home they're buying in Provence
- Get a 50k student loan at 0\% interest, and invest it all in a World ETF over the next 10 years. I don't need the money as I'm already paid 1,5k a month by my school
- One week in New York City

July
- One week in Nice
- One week in the South of Spain (province of Huelva)

August 
- Two weeks in Poland
	- One week in the childhood village of my girlfriends' parents
	- One week in Krak√≥w with my parents
- A few days in my grandmother's village in Provence
- One week in Nice with friends

When I have some free time I'll try to do some [[fitness|exercice]] to not lose all my gains over the summer, and I'll read some blogs in my free time.
