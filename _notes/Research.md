title: Research ideas
---

Topics I could be interested in as a future researcher : 
- Empirical economics : probably urban/labor, but could also be health, criminality, welfare..
	- But I am wary, having read Bryan Caplan's doubts on econometrics. More research needed
- Theoretical economics
	- Public choice
- Progress studies
	- Missing markets : blood donations, immigraton
	- R&D?
	- Longterm economic growth
- Immigration
- International relations, war analyst, geohistory


I like interdisciplinarity: Caplan's applied pscyhology, Pueyo's geohistory, etc.  
I like popularising: like bloggers, D.Cohen, OWiD..


Careers I could see myself having : 
- Research in a university
- Research outside of a university : think tank, government department, international organization
- CIA-analyst-type job
