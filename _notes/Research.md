title: Research ideas
---

Topics I could be interested in as a future researcher : 
- Empirical economics : urban, labor
	- But I am wary, having read Bryan Caplan's doubts on econometrics. More research needed
- Theoretical economics
	- Public choice
- Progress studies
	- Missing markets : blood donations, immigraton
- International relations, war analyst, geohistory

Careers I could see myself having : 
- Research in a university
- Research outside of a university : think tank, government department, international organization
- CIA-analyst-type job
